/*
This RFduino sketch demonstrates a full bi-directional Bluetooth Low
Energy 4 connection between an iPhone application and an RFduino.

This sketch works with the rfduinoLedButton iPhone application.

The button on the iPhone can be used to turn the green led on or off.
The button state of button 1 is transmitted to the iPhone and shown in
the application.
